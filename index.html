	          <h2> Swazoo Claybon</h2>
	          	<p class="help-block">Swazoo Claybon, III is majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Robotics. Swazoo likes to play tennis and piano in his free time. He is also one of the co-presidents of the Washington University component of <a href = "http://orchestra.lemp-arts.org/staff/">Orchestrating Diversity </a>where he tutors at-risk students and teaches piano on weekends and has volunteered in the program for three years. He enjoys reading research and learning about new computer vision advancements and new tech startups. He has  a well-rounded research background ranging from significant biomedical research at Texas A&M in the NanoBio Systems Lab where he conducted “Lab on a Chip: Gene Delivery (Transformation) by Microfluidic Sonoporation in Plant Cells research”  to autonomous mobile robotics <a href = "https://undergradresearch.wustl.edu/files/undergradresearch/imce/fall_2014_symposium_program_final.pdf">research</a> conducted at Washington University in St. Louis.  He believes that the fusion of these two technical areas are the wave of the future, and his goal is to continue to develop a background to be a part of and contribute in a strong environment that adds value to this new technical revolution. In the fall of 2015, Swazoo will attend graduate school in Electrical Engineering at Virginia Tech where he hopes to focus on computer vision and machine learning.</p>
	          	<h2>Satish Chandrasekhar</h2>
	          	 <p class="help-block">Satish Chandrasekhar is currently double majoring in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at Wash U. As he has always been interested in biology and human physiology, he wants to become a doctor and is currently applying to medical school for post-undergraduate study in 2015. As both an engineer and aspiring physician, Satish loves to find and create connections between the medical and engineering realms in order to bring a different approach to both fields. In his spare time, Satish very much enjoys watching sports and is a varsity and intramural bowler, while shadowing in the clinic and operating room whenever possible. He is also known for his (often nerdy) jokes in a variety of situations, most of which go unappreciated.</p>

	            <p class="help-block">Brittany is a hard-working engineer with experience in research and client services. She is in love with cities, systems, efficiency, and innovation - passions that have influenced her studies and goals. It's hard to pull her away from a problem before she solves it and she is always thinking of new ideas - She thrives in spaces filled with other creative minds. Brittany's greatest desire is to impact, inspire, and support those around her, and wants to leave her mark by impacting the world by being a part of something bigger than herself. Using technology to create innovative applications that will ease the lives of its users and to bridge soceital gaps in accessibility is how she envisions her contribution to this goal.

	          <h1>Our Project</h1>
	          <h2> Specifications</h2>
	            <p class="help-block">We are a group of electrical engineering seniors who have worked to design a knee stretch monitor for use by postoperative knee surgery patients and those suffering from knee or knee-related injuries. The goal of this device is to allow the patient to monitor his or her knee stretches, as well as to provide feedback to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) detailing his or her progress, while motivating the patient through alerts to continue stretching in order to avoid more costly surgeries. However, this device is only meant to be used to monitor certain types of knee stretches that primarily consist of measuring the angle of the knee during bending and/or the level of the leg during leg raise exercises. The device will not be used to transmit patient data to third parties, such as the patient's medical provider or physical therapist in order to comply with HIPAA regulations.
